# Cognifyz Technologies Internship

This Internship tasks are focused around analyzing Investment Avenues Data.

**What are Investment Avenues?**

Let’s say you have some extra money. Now, instead of keeping it under your mattress, you decide you want it to grow over time. Where you choose to put your money to grow is what we call Investment Avenues. Example: stocks, bonds, PPF, equity, gold etc

**The Reason for Analyzing this data?**

1. Understanding Their Investors: Businesses, especially those that are publicly traded and offer stocks, want to understand where their investors are coming from and what they’re looking for.
2. Raising Capital: When businesses need money to grow, they might sell stocks or bonds. Knowing which investment avenues are popular helps them decide the best way to raise funds. If stocks are hot, issuing new shares might be a good call. If investors are cautious and prefer bonds, a company might go that route.
3. Investing Their Own Money: Businesses also have cash reserves they need to manage. By analyzing investment trends, they can decide where to park their excess cash.
4. Strategic Decisions and Partnerships: Knowing investment trends can help businesses make strategic choices, like mergers, acquisitions, or partnerships. If a particular sector is attracting a lot of investment, a company might consider expanding into that area or partnering with firms in that sector.
5. Market Positioning: A business can position itself more attractively in the market by aligning with investment trends. This can enhance its brand image, attract more customers and even improve its stock price if it’s seen as a leader in a hot investment area.


## Task-1 : EDA using Python
## Task-2: PowerBI Dashboard
**Data Preprocessing**

I eliminated redundant columns and null values using Power Query in Power BI. Additionally, I utilized data groups to categorize individuals into different age groups.

**Dashboard**

I crafted a dashboard featuring a KPI for average age, a slicer for gender and buttons for easy navigation across different sections.

There are three main dashboards:

a. Demographic Insights: This section focuses on age groups, whether individuals invested in avenues, the duration of their investments and their expected returns.

Key Insights:

1. The average age is 27.8 years.
2. The majority fall within the 26-30 age group.
3. A significant portion preferred investments lasting 3-5 years.
4. Most anticipated a 20-30% increase in returns.

b. Investment Avenues: Here, I explore the percentage of people who invested in various avenues like the stock market. I’ve also analyzed the preferred investment duration (yearly, monthly, weekly) and the most favored investment types.

Key Insights:

1. 92.5% opted for investment avenues.
2. 87.5% invested in the stock market.
3. 73% favored monthly investments.
4. Mutual funds were the top choice, with 45% of both males and females, closely followed by equity.

c. Investment Motivations: This dashboard explores reasons for investment, considering factors like returns, risk, locking period and their saving objectives.

Key Insights:

1. 63% cited returns as their primary investment factor.
2. 60% were saving for retirement.
3. Around 80% aimed for wealth creation through their investments
